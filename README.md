**Hello Patrons! I want to thank you greatly for helping to support the development and maintenance of ST MANAGER by supporting us!**

Now that you're a  Patron, here's how you access ST MANAGER PREMIUM

1). Make sure you have your Discord account linked to your Patreon account. You can find the instructions for doing so here: 

https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-Getting-Discord-access

2). Use **/check_premium**  to check your subscription status and use **/activate_premium** to activate premium in your server.

3.). Wait up to 5 minutes for our database to update, and once that's done, you can invite the bot using this invite link:

https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=891955985520939019&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2Ff8U2FjFS4B&response_type=code&scope=bot%20applications.commands

The bot needs the audit log permission to verify if the person who added the bot is also a Patron. If you encounter any issues with adding or  using the bot, contact me at gb952444@gmail.com or message my Discord  kabinzz
You can also join our Discord server here:

I hope you will find this bot useful, as I will be adding new features and improving the bot constantly.

Thank you for your support! ðŸ’–
